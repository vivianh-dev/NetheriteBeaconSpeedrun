# Resource Breakdown Structure for Netherite Beacon Speedrun

This GitHub repository is a full breakdown on the blocks, structures, biomes, farms, and items needed in order to optimize for time.

This guide does not assume a playercount, or the speed at which these farms can be built. If you have enough players, some farms such as the gold farm and witch farm can be skipped in favor of manual resource collection. These optimizations are player dependent, and require an analysis of player skill, speed, and knowledge.

Each step should have links, either in-document symlinks or links to videos/schematics, to the necessary information. Farm outlines will list rates and credit if information is known. 

To start, either view the page on the [netherite beacon](/builds/netherite_beacon.md), or view the directory to find a specific page. This wiki is a directed single sink graph, meaning you can get to any page from anywhere.
